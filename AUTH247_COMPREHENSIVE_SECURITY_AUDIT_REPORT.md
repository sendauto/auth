- PIN-based email verification system
- Enterprise-grade MFA enforcement policies
```

**Password Security**
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (industry standard)
- **Breach Detection**: Known compromised password checking
- **Password History**: Prevents reuse of last 5 passwords
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts, 30-minute lockout

**OAuth Integration**
- Support for Google, GitHub, Microsoft OAuth providers
- Project-specific credential management

#### ‚ùå **Critical Authentication Vulnerabilities**

**Mock Authentication Middleware (CRITICAL)**
```typescript
// server/middleware/auth.ts lines 25-33
export function requireAuth() {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Mock authentication - in production would validate JWT/session
    req.user = {
      id: 1,
      email: 'admin@auth247.net',
      roles: ['super_admin', 'admin', 'manager', 'user'],
      tenant: 1
    };
    next();
  };

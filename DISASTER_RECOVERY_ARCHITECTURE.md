# Auth247 Disaster Recovery & Geographic Data Distribution Architecture

## Overview

Auth247 implements enterprise-grade disaster recovery with geographic data distribution to ensure zero data loss and maximum availability even in the event of major disasters affecting entire regions.

## Geographic Data Distribution Strategy

### 1. Multi-Region Database Replication

**Primary Architecture:**
- **Primary Region**: US East (Virginia) - Main database cluster
- **Secondary Region**: EU West (Ireland) - Real-time replica
- **Tertiary Region**: Asia Pacific (Singapore) - Read replica with 15-minute lag
- **Backup Region**: US West (California) - Cold backup with daily sync

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL streaming replication configuration
-- Primary server (US East)
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_segments = 64

-- Secondary servers receive continuous WAL streaming
-- Automatic failover in < 30 seconds
```

### 2. Data Sharding by Geographic Location

**User Data Distribution:**
- **Americas**: Stored primarily in US East, replicated to US West
- **Europe/Africa**: Stored primarily in EU West, replicated to US East
- **Asia/Pacific**: Stored primarily in Singapore, replicated to EU West
- **Critical Data**: Authentication tokens and session data replicated to ALL regions

**Benefits:**
- Reduced latency for users in each region
- Compliance with data sovereignty laws (GDPR, etc.)
- Isolated failure domains prevent total system loss

### 3. Real-Time Cross-Region Synchronization

**Synchronization Strategy:**
- **Authentication Events**: Synchronized to all regions within 100ms
- **User Profile Changes**: Synchronized within 5 seconds
- **System Configuration**: Synchronized within 1 minute
- **Audit Logs**: Replicated to at least 3 regions immediately

## Disaster Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. Automated Failover System

**Detection & Response:**
```javascript
// Disaster detection system
const disasterDetection = {
  healthChecks: {
    database: '5-second intervals',
    application: '10-second intervals', 
    network: 'continuous monitoring'
  },
  
  failoverTriggers: [
    'Database unavailable > 30 seconds',
    'Application errors > 50% for 60 seconds',
    'Network partitioning detected',
    'Manual disaster declaration'
  ],
  
  recoveryTime: {
    detection: '< 30 seconds',
    failover: '< 2 minutes', 
    fullRecovery: '< 15 minutes'
  }
}
```

### 2. Data Backup Strategy

**Multi-Tier Backup System:**

**Tier 1 - Continuous Backup:**
- Real-time WAL (Write-Ahead Log) streaming to 3 regions
- Point-in-time recovery capability to any second within 30 days
- Encrypted backups with separate encryption keys per region

**Tier 2 - Daily Full Backups:**
- Complete database snapshots stored in 4 different cloud providers
- Geographic distribution: US, EU, Asia, Australia
- Retention: 90 days with incremental compression

**Tier 3 - Weekly Archive Backups:**
- Long-term archive storage in glacier-class storage
- Retention: 7 years for compliance requirements
- Cross-cloud redundancy (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, private storage)

### 3. Network-Level Redundancy

**Multi-Provider Network Strategy:**
- **Primary**: Cloudflare global CDN with 200+ edge locations
- **Secondary**: AWS CloudFront for backup CDN services  
- **Tertiary**: Direct peering agreements with major ISPs
- **Emergency**: Satellite backup connectivity for critical regions

## Regional Isolation & Load Balancing

### 1. Smart Load Distribution

**Geographic Load Balancing:**
```javascript
const loadBalancingStrategy = {
  primaryRouting: 'geographic proximity',
  fallbackRouting: 'least latency',
  disasterRouting: 'available capacity',
  
  trafficDistribution: {
    'us-east': '40% of global traffic',
    'eu-west': '35% of global traffic', 
    'ap-southeast': '20% of global traffic',
    'us-west': '5% overflow capacity'
  }
}
```

### 2. Regional Data Sovereignty

**Compliance Architecture:**
- **EU Users**: Data stored in EU region, GDPR compliant
- **US Users**: Data stored in US regions, SOX/HIPAA compliant
- **APAC Users**: Data stored in Singapore, local compliance met
- **Cross-Border**: Encrypted metadata only, no PII transfer

## Disaster Scenarios & Response Plans

### 1. Single Region Failure

**Scenario**: Natural disaster affects US East region
**Response Time**: < 2 minutes
**Actions**:
1. Automatic traffic redirection to EU West region
2. Promote EU West replica to primary database
3. Update DNS records globally (30-second TTL)
4. Notify users of temporary increased latency

**Data Impact**: Zero data loss (real-time replication)

### 2. Multi-Region Network Partition

**Scenario**: Submarine cable cuts isolate regions
**Response Time**: < 5 minutes
**Actions**:
1. Each region operates independently with cached data
2. Conflict resolution activates upon reconnection
3. Emergency satellite links establish minimal connectivity
4. Users continue authentication with regional data

**Data Impact**: Minimal (< 5 minutes of potential conflicts)

### 3. Cloud Provider Outage

**Scenario**: Major cloud provider experiences outage
**Response Time**: < 10 minutes
**Actions**:
1. Activate multi-cloud disaster recovery plan
2. DNS failover to backup cloud infrastructure
3. Restore from most recent cross-cloud backup
4. Implement hybrid cloud temporary architecture

**Data Impact**: < 15 minutes of data (backup frequency)

## Business Continuity Features

### 1. Zero-Downtime Maintenance

**Rolling Updates:**
- Database schema changes applied with zero downtime
- Application updates deployed region by region
- Traffic gradually shifted during maintenance windows
- Automatic rollback if issues detected

### 2. Compliance & Audit Continuity

**Audit Trail Protection:**
- Audit logs replicated to immutable storage in 5 regions
- Blockchain-based integrity verification
- Legal hold capabilities that survive disasters
- Regulatory reporting continues during outages

### 3. Customer Communication

**Disaster Communication Plan:**
- Automated status page updates within 60 seconds
- Email/SMS notifications to administrators
- API status endpoints remain available during disasters
- Real-time incident tracking and resolution updates

## Cost Optimization

### 1. Intelligent Storage Tiering

**Storage Strategy:**
- **Hot Data** (active users): High-performance SSD in all regions
- **Warm Data** (inactive < 30 days): Standard storage in 2 regions  
- **Cold Data** (inactive > 30 days): Archive storage in 1 region
- **Frozen Data** (compliance only): Glacier storage globally

### 2. Regional Cost Balancing

**Cost Optimization:**
- Primary operations in lowest-cost regions when possible
- Disaster recovery in higher-cost regions only when needed
- Automatic scaling down of unused disaster recovery capacity
- Reserved instance planning for predictable disaster recovery costs
